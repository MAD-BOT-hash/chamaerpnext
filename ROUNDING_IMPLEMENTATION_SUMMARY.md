# Rounding Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of rounding for monetary values in the SHG app to ensure all financial figures are rounded to 2 decimal places before saving.

## Overview

All monetary values in the SHG app have been updated to ensure they are rounded to 2 decimal places before saving to the database. This prevents floating-point precision issues and ensures consistent financial calculations.

## Files Updated

### 1. SHG Loan (shg/shg/doctype/shg_loan/shg_loan.py)

**Changes Made:**
1. Added rounding to the validate method for monthly_installment
2. Added rounding to the calculate_repayment_details method for both flat rate and reducing balance calculations
3. Both monthly_installment and total_payable fields are now rounded to 2 decimal places

**Code Added:**
```python
# In validate method
# Ensure monthly installment is always rounded to 2 decimals
if self.monthly_installment:
    self.monthly_installment = round(float(self.monthly_installment), 2)

# In calculate_repayment_details method (flat rate)
# Ensure monetary values are rounded to 2 decimal places
if self.total_payable:
    self.total_payable = round(float(self.total_payable), 2)
if self.monthly_installment:
    self.monthly_installment = round(float(self.monthly_installment), 2)

# In calculate_repayment_details method (reducing balance)
# Ensure monetary values are rounded to 2 decimal places
if self.monthly_installment:
    self.monthly_installment = round(float(self.monthly_installment), 2)
if self.total_payable:
    self.total_payable = round(float(self.total_payable), 2)
```

### 2. SHG Loan Repayment (shg/shg/doctype/shg_loan_repayment/shg_loan_repayment.py)

**Changes Made:**
1. Added rounding to the validate method for all monetary fields
2. Added rounding to the calculate_repayment_breakdown method for all calculated fields

**Code Added:**
```python
# In validate method
# Ensure monetary values are rounded to 2 decimal places
if self.total_paid:
    self.total_paid = round(float(self.total_paid), 2)
if self.principal_amount:
    self.principal_amount = round(float(self.principal_amount), 2)
if self.interest_amount:
    self.interest_amount = round(float(self.interest_amount), 2)
if self.penalty_amount:
    self.penalty_amount = round(float(self.penalty_amount), 2)
if self.balance_after_payment:
    self.balance_after_payment = round(float(self.balance_after_payment), 2)

# In calculate_repayment_breakdown method
# Ensure monetary values are rounded to 2 decimal places
if self.penalty_amount:
    self.penalty_amount = round(float(self.penalty_amount), 2)
if self.interest_amount:
    self.interest_amount = round(float(self.interest_amount), 2)
if self.principal_amount:
    self.principal_amount = round(float(self.principal_amount), 2)
if self.balance_after_payment:
    self.balance_after_payment = round(float(self.balance_after_payment), 2)
```

### 3. SHG Contribution (shg/shg/doctype/shg_contribution/shg_contribution.py)

**Changes Made:**
1. Added rounding to the validate method for the amount field

**Code Added:**
```python
# In validate method
# Ensure amount is rounded to 2 decimal places
if self.amount:
    self.amount = round(float(self.amount), 2)
```

### 4. SHG Meeting Fine (shg/shg/doctype/shg_meeting_fine/shg_meeting_fine.py)

**Changes Made:**
1. Added rounding to the validate method for the fine_amount field

**Code Added:**
```python
# In validate method
# Ensure fine_amount is rounded to 2 decimal places
if self.fine_amount:
    self.fine_amount = round(float(self.fine_amount), 2)
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All monetary values are consistently rounded to 2 decimal places
2. **Accuracy**: Prevents floating-point precision issues in financial calculations
3. **Compliance**: Ensures financial records match standard accounting practices
4. **User Experience**: Provides clean, readable financial figures in the UI

## Testing

All updated functions have been verified to ensure:
1. The rounding logic is correctly implemented
2. No syntax errors were introduced
3. The functionality remains unchanged except for the added rounding
4. All monetary values are properly rounded before saving

## Implementation Notes

1. The rounding is applied in the validate method of each doctype, which is called before saving
2. All rounding uses Python's built-in round() function with 2 decimal places
3. Fields are only rounded if they have a value (not None or 0)
4. The float() conversion ensures we're working with numeric values before rounding
