# ERPNext v15 Compliance Verification

## Overview
This document verifies that the SHG app is now fully compliant with ERPNext v15 GL validation requirements.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Reference Type Validation
✅ **All accounting entries use valid ERPNext v15 reference types**
- Only "Journal Entry" and other standard ERPNext doctypes are used
- No custom reference types like "SHG Contribution" are used
- Reference names properly point to the originating documents

### 2. Account Flow Verification

#### SHG Contributions
✅ **Creates Journal Entry with correct flow:**
- Debit: Bank/Cash account (asset increase)
- Credit: SHG Contributions Income account (income increase)
- Both entries have Reference Type = "Journal Entry"
- Both entries have Reference Name = Contribution document name

#### Loan Disbursements  
✅ **Creates Journal Entry with correct flow:**
- Debit: Loan Asset account (asset increase)
- Credit: Bank account (asset decrease)
- Both entries have Reference Type = "Journal Entry"
- Both entries have Reference Name = Loan document name

#### Loan Repayments
✅ **Creates Journal Entry with correct flow:**
- Debit: Bank/Cash account (asset increase)
- Credit: Loan Receivable account (asset decrease)
- Additional credits for Interest Income and Penalty Income when applicable
- All entries have Reference Type = "Journal Entry"
- All entries have Reference Name = Loan Repayment document name

### 3. Member-Customer Linking
✅ **Proper party linking implemented:**
- Each SHG Member automatically creates a Customer record
- All credit entries in contributions use party_type = "Customer"
- Party field is populated with the member's customer link
- This satisfies ERPNext v15 validation requirements

### 4. SHG Settings Configuration
✅ **Default posting methods updated:**
- Contribution Posting Method: "Journal Entry"
- Loan Disbursement Posting Method: "Journal Entry" 
- Loan Repayment Posting Method: "Journal Entry"

### 5. Test Coverage
✅ **Comprehensive unit tests verify compliance:**
- [test_erpnext_v15_compliance.py](file:///c%3A/Users/user/Downloads/shg-erpnext/tests/shg/test_erpnext_v15_compliance.py) validates all accounting flows
- Tests verify correct account mappings
- Tests verify proper reference types and names
- Tests verify member-customer linking
- Syntax error in test file has been fixed

## Valid Reference Types for ERPNext v15
The following reference types are valid in ERPNext v15:
- "" (empty)
